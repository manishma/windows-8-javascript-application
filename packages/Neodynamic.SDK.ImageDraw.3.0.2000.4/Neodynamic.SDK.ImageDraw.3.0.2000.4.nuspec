ImageDraw is a lightweight royalty-free .NET component (.NET DLL Class Library a.k.a. assembly) which lets you to easily add advanced Imaging Effects and Dynamic Image Composition to any .NET Framework-based applications. ImageDraw allows you to use all the potential of GDI+ to dynamically create composite images (Supporting image files, Texts like captions and watermarks as well as AutoShapes (lines and arrows, rectangles, ovals, polygons, stars, etc)) with lots of useful built-in Imaging Effects like drop shadows, reflections, perspective views, Polaroid, filmstrip, scaling, resizing, skewing, and so on. Main Features: 1- Dynamic image composition supporting Images (from files, base64 strings, BLOBs, etc.), Texts &amp;amp; WordArt  (autosize, multi-line, custom font files support), and AutoShapes like lines, arrows, rectangles, rounded rectangles, polygons, stars, ovals, callouts (speech bubbles), paths, and so on.  2- Lots of useful Imaging Effects out of the box, including: Adjust Brightness, Contrast, Gamma, Hue, Saturation, Opacity, HSL; Convert To Grayscale, Negative, Sepia, Black &amp;amp; White; Crop, Drop REAL Shadow, Flip, Make Transparent, Perspective Shadow, Resize, Scale, Rotate, Round Corners, Silhouette, Stretch, Decorative Border, Glass Table, Mail Stamp, Polaroid, Filmstrip, Skew, Perspective View, Camera view, Gaussian Blur, Distort Corners, Remove Transparency, Perspective Reflection, Red-Eye Removal, Feather, Glow, Fade, BitmapMask, Remove Pixel, Color Substitution, Tint, Emboss, Solarize, Pixelate, Sharpen, Focal Grayscale, Focal Pixelate, Focal Soften, Focal Tint, and Museum Matte Frame.  3- Accepts as image sources the following formats: GIF, JPG/JPEG, BMP, TIFF, ICO, WMF, EMF and PNG. 4- Renders images on-fly in formats such as GIF, JPG/JPEG, BMP, Wireless Bitmap ( WBMP ) and PNG. 5- Support for Multipage TIFF</description>
